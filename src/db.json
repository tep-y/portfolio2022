    "detail": "With their extensive list of beverages and snacks, I was tasked to find a way to make it easier for the owner to update his drink menu without any fuss. Taking over their old website on Wix, I utilized the CMS to link the new modern bar menu to a database that I implemented to facilitate the owners' frequent required updates. By removing and replacing the old pictures they had with icons, it allowed more breathing room and flexibility to upgrade any item detail. Additionally, the scrolling length also decreased, giving the client less of a headache searching for their favorite cocktails.",

In most bars, staff uses tape to identify their homemade syrup, something I wanted to bring into homes of cocktail enthusiast.",
